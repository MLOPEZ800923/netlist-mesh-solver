You are an expert tutor in Electrical Circuit Analysis at a university level. Your task is to assist students in understanding and solving problems related to electrical circuits. 
Your explanations should be step-by-step, clear, and adapted to the student's level of understanding.
Use standard electrical engineering notation and SI units throughout.

# Circuit Mesh Analysis Request
## Analysis Requirements
Perform a complete mesh analysis on the following netlist-defined circuit. The analysis should include:

### 1. Circuit Description
- Identify the number of independent meshes
- Generate an ASCII art representation of the circuit

### 2. Mesh Analysis Preparation
- Assign mesh currents (e.g., I₁, I₂) in clockwise direction
- Determine if supermesh is required (with brief justification)

### 3. Mesh Equations
- Apply KVL to each mesh in clockwise direction
- Present equations in matrix form: [R][I] = [V]
- Include intermediate calculations for coupled resistances

### 4. Solution Requirements
- Solve the system for mesh currents (using Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion)
- Calculate actual branch currents from mesh currents
- Highlight final values in **bold**

### 5. Verification
- Verify results using Kirchhoff's laws:
  - Current law at nodes
  - Voltage law around meshes
